Waking up is hard and starting the day dehydrated isn't too good either. That's why I created the Aqualarm, an alarm clock which requires you to drink a glass of water to turn it off.

The scale is first zeroed to the weight of the empty bottle. Once the alarm is set, the bottle is filled and placed on the scale. When the alarm goes off in the morning it will not stop until the water is drunken and the empty bottle is returned to the platform.

The load cell used for weight measurement was taken from a cheap kitchen scale, and is connected to a [HX711](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13879){:.link} load cell amp from SparkFun. The ATmega328 microcontroller (i.e an Arduino Uno) records the weight, sets the time, and drives the 7-segment, LED display and piezo buzzer. I designed the circuit board in Altium and routed it using a LPFK board router. The case was laser-cut from from acrylic. The code and drawings/designs are available on my [Github](https://github.com/kbre93){:.link}.
