        <p>The magic mirror it is a device for self-reflection. As you give yourself your morning prep talk, the magic mirror briefs you on your day — upcoming events on your calendar, the weather forecast, and a motivational quote.</p>

<p>This was one of the first builds I had seen that I had wished I had come up with myself. There are quite a few builds online but the code I used was from <a href="http://michaelteeuw.nl/tagged/magicmirror" class="link">Michael Teeuw’s</a> build.</p>

<div class="description" id="post_sub_heading"> 
	Build details
</div>

<p>In short, an LED monitor hides behind the one-way mirror and is connected to a Raspberry Pi. The computer is running a Apache server, which has access to your calendar to show upcoming events, an open source weather website for the forecast, and a list of motivational quotes. The details can be found at the link above. The modifications I made were adding the quotes at the bottom of the display and a PIR sensor to turn off the mirror when no one is in the room.</p>

<div class="description" id="post_sub_heading"> 
	Lessons
</div>

<p>I learnt how to set up a Raspberry Pi to run as a kiosk, a timber manipulation techniques and how valuable it is to know people who own tools.</p>

<div class="description" id="post_sub_heading"> 
	Improvements
</div>

<p>I would have ideally made the mirror a bit thinner but this was difficult due to budget constraints. It would also be nice to have a display where the black pixels are completely off. As far as I know, this is only possible with an OLED display, which is also a pricey solution. Alternatively, a few, smaller displays could be used in only the regions which display things.</p>
